        <h2>About my hobbies</h2>
        <p>I'm a gamer I can spend countless hours just gaming. My favourite games are the Dark Souls trilogy. They're fantasy adventure games where the protagonist isn't the hero like in most games. And they're known for their difficulty</p>
        <p>If I ever need a break from gaming I like to watch TV Series. My favourite genre is fantasy, and my favourite series is Supernatural, which is about 2 brothers fighting against the supernatural world</p>
        <p>And if I ever need a break from the computer screen I like to read books. My favourite genre is you guessed it fantasy. My favourite books are the Soul Force Saga by James E. Wisher.</p>
